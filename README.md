# Films_Review_Sentiment_Analysis


1) I have used Tensorflow to make a model that can classify a Movie review as Positive/Negitive.

2) Using binary_crossentropy loss function and running for 10 epochs it give an accuracy of 97%

3) Using the meta.tsv and vecs.tsv file You can also see the virtual view of the sentiment analysis at http://projector.tensorflow.org/
